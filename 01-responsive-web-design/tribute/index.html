    <p class="mb-0">"I was kind of an unhappy kid. I always felt like a cynical
      New Yorker trapped in a little kid's body. I started to get some pretty bad
      anxiety disorders around puberty, which totally did not work with growing up a
      mile away from the beach. I started cutting my own hair.""</p>
